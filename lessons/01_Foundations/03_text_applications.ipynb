    "# Text Applications: Prompt Engineering Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook explores **nine essential prompt engineering patterns** for text-based applications. Each pattern solves specific challenges and teaches you how to construct effective prompts through modular, transparent techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What You'll Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Nine Patterns:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Core Patterns (I-VI)\n",
    "1. **List Generation** - Structured content creation with instructions, examples, and constraints\n",
    "2. **Sentiment Analysis** - Few-shot learning for classification tasks\n",
    "3. **ELI5 (Explain Like I'm Five)** - Simplifying complex topics with audience-specific language\n",
    "4. **Least-to-Most** - Problem decomposition for symbolic manipulation tasks\n",
    "5. **Clear Instructions with Delimiters** - Separating instructions from content for security and clarity\n",
    "6. **Step-by-Step Reasoning** - Process decomposition through sequential transformations\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advanced Patterns (VII-IX)\n",
    "7. **Chain-of-Thought (CoT)** - Reasoning transparency for complex problem-solving\n",
    "8. **Structured Output** - Machine-readable JSON/XML generation for applications\n",
    "9. **Text Transformation** - Style transfer and audience adaptation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Each section follows a consistent structure:\n",
    "- **Goal & Techniques**: What the pattern does and when to use it\n",
    "- **Explanation**: Why the pattern works and real-world applications\n",
    "- **Modular Construction**: Building prompts with transparent, variable-based components\n",
    "- **Execution**: Running and observing the results\n",
    "- **Student Exercises**: Hands-on practice with challenges and discussion questions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Distinctions\n",
    "\n",
    "Pay special attention to:\n",
    "- **Section IV vs VI**: Problem decomposition (what to solve) vs. Process decomposition (how to transform)\n",
    "- **Section VI vs VII**: Process chaining (transformation steps) vs. Reasoning transparency (logic steps)\n",
    "- **Few-shot Learning**: Using examples to guide model behavior\n",
    "- **Delimiters**: Security and clarity in production applications\n",
    "- **Human vs Machine Output**: Prose (I-VII, IX) vs. Structured data (VIII)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "- Basic Python knowledge\n",
    "- Understanding of string formatting and f-strings\n",
    "- Familiarity with LLM concepts (prompts, completions)\n",
    "\n",

    "   Order #1: 3 apples at $1 each\n",
    "   Order #2: 2 oranges at $1.50 each\n",

    "   \"Two thousand\" → 2000\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Schema validation**:\n",
    "   After getting JSON output, write validation code:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   def validate_product(data):\n",
    "       required_fields = [\"product_name\", \"price\", \"specs\"]\n",
    "       # Check all required fields exist\n",

    "       # Return list of errors or True\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Discussion Questions**:\n",

    "- What's the tradeoff between strict schemas and flexible output?\n",

    "   - 2TB NVMe SSD\n",
    "   - Liquid cooling system\n",
    "   - RGB lighting\n",

    "   # Transform each feature into a customer benefit\n",

    "1. **Multi-dimensional transformation**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # Transform simultaneously:\n",
    "   # - Tone: Formal → Casual\n",
    "   # - Format: Paragraph → List\n",

    "   # Transform new content to match that specific voice\n",
    "   # Identify: sentence structure, vocabulary choices, tone markers\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **A/B testing variations**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # Create 3 different transformations of same text:\n",
    "   # Version A: Emotional appeal\n",
    "   # Version B: Data-driven, logical\n",
    "   # Version C: Storytelling narrative\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Consistency checking**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # After transformation, verify:\n",
    "   # - All facts preserved\n",
    "   # - No information added\n",
    "   # - Target style achieved\n",
    "   # Write validation code to check these automatically\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Discussion Questions**:\n",
    "- When might transformation introduce unintended bias?\n",
    "- How do you balance simplification with accuracy?\n",
    "- What content should never be transformed (e.g., legal, medical)?\n",
    "- How does transformation differ from paraphrasing or summarization?\n",
    "- Can you combine transformation with other patterns (CoT, structured output)?"
