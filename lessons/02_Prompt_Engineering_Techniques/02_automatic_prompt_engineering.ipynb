    "## 🎯 Learning Objectives\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you will be able to:\n",
    "1. Understand what Automatic Prompt Engineering (APE) is and why it matters\n",
    "2. Use LLMs to optimize prompts automatically\n",
    "3. Apply APE to improve prompt quality and effectiveness\n",

    "## 📚 What is APE?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Automatic Prompt Engineering (APE)** is a technique where we use an LLM to improve and optimize prompts for us, rather than manually refining them through trial and error.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Problem:\n",
    "Writing effective prompts is challenging:\n",
    "- Takes time and expertise\n",
    "- Requires understanding of prompt engineering best practices\n",
    "- Often needs multiple iterations to get right\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Solution:\n",
    "Use an AI to help write better AI prompts! APE leverages the LLM's knowledge of:\n",
    "- Effective instruction structures\n",
    "- Clear communication patterns\n",
    "- Best practices from thousands of examples\n",

    "## Section 2: Basic APE Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔧 How APE Works:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1:** Define a meta-prompt (system instruction) that teaches the LLM about prompt engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2:** Provide your initial prompt that needs optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3:** Specify requirements for the optimized prompt\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 4:** Let the LLM generate an improved version\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Three Components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`system`**: Meta-prompt that establishes the LLM as a prompt engineering expert\n",
    "   - Defines the task (optimize prompts)\n",
    "   - Explains prompt engineering principles\n",
    "   - Lists best practices to follow\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`requirements`**: Specific constraints and rules for the optimization\n",
    "   - Must include all best practices\n",
    "   - Add diverse examples\n",
    "   - Return only the optimized prompt\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`prompt`**: The initial prompt we want to improve\n",
    "   - Contains the basic task\n",
    "   - May have variables like `{product_description}`\n",
    "   - Includes some examples but might need improvement\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 Key Insight:\n",
    "We're treating prompt engineering as a task that can be automated using the same LLMs we're creating prompts for!"

    "## 🎓 Reflection and Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "### Questions to Consider:\n",
    "1. **How did the second optimized prompt differ from the first?**\n",
    "2. **Which version provides clearer instructions?**\n",
    "3. **Are the examples diverse enough to guide the LLM?**\n",
    "4. **Does the prompt follow all four best practices?**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 APE Best Practices:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Be Specific in Your Requirements:**\n",
    "- The quality of optimization depends on clear requirements\n",
    "- List exactly what you want (format, style, examples, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Iterate Multiple Times:**\n",
    "- First optimization is rarely perfect\n",
    "- Refine requirements based on output\n",
    "- Test with actual data\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Balance Automation and Human Judgment:**\n",
    "- APE saves time but needs human evaluation\n",
    "- Review optimized prompts critically\n",
    "- Test with edge cases\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Document Your Meta-Prompts:**\n",
    "- Save successful system instructions\n",
    "- Build a library of optimization strategies\n",
    "- Share effective patterns with your team\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚀 Next Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Try These Experiments:**\n",
    "1. **Different domains**: Apply APE to customer service, code generation, or creative writing prompts\n",
    "2. **Additional constraints**: Add token limits, tone requirements, or audience specifications\n",
    "3. **Chain optimization**: Use APE output as input for another round of refinement\n",
    "4. **A/B testing**: Generate multiple versions and compare performance\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📊 When to Use APE:\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Good Use Cases:**\n",
    "- Initial prompt creation (get a strong starting point)\n",
    "- Standardizing prompt format across a team\n",
    "- Scaling prompt engineering efforts\n",
    "- Learning prompt engineering techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **Not Ideal For:**\n",
    "- Highly specialized domain knowledge (LLM may not know best practices)\n",
    "- Prompts requiring strict regulatory compliance\n",
    "- Tasks where you need full control over every word\n",
