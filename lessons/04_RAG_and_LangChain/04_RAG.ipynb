    "# RAG with OpenAI Embeddings + FAISS\n",
    "\n",
    "This workbook demonstrates a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) workflow:\n",
    "- Load a live-news web page, clean the text, split into chunks.\n",
    "- Embed chunks with OpenAI embeddings and index them in FAISS.\n",
    "- Retrieve the most relevant chunks for a question and answer with an LLM.\n",
    "- Show citations (source and chunk index) for transparency.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What are Embeddings?\n",
    "Embeddings are dense numeric vectors that represent text. They capture semantic meaning so that similar texts have similar vectors. We use OpenAI's `text-embedding-3-small` to convert each chunk into a vector, enabling similarity search.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a Vector DB (FAISS)?\n",
    "FAISS is a high-performance vector database/index for fast nearest-neighbor search. We store the chunk embeddings in FAISS and query it with the question's embedding to retrieve the top-k most relevant chunks. This powers the \"retrieve\" step before the LLM answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Workflow Overview\n",
    "1) Load + clean content\n",
    "2) Split into chunks (with metadata)\n",
    "3) Embed chunks and build FAISS index\n",
    "4) Retrieve top-k chunks for the query\n",
    "5) Format context and call the LLM\n",
    "6) Print answer and cite sources\n",
    "\n",
    "Prerequisite: set `OPENAI_API_KEY` in your environment."
