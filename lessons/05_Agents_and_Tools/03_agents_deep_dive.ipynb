    "### Learning Goals\n",
    "- Understand how tool-calling works in a simple agent loop.\n",
    "- See how assistant tool-calls must be followed by `role: tool` responses.\n",
    "- Build a minimal loop that runs until no more tool-calls are required.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works\n",
    "1. User asks a question.\n",
    "2. Model may request tools (functions) by emitting `tool_calls`.\n",
    "3. Your code executes the requested tools and replies with `role: tool` messages using each `tool_call_id`.\n",
    "4. Repeat until the model stops requesting tools; then show the final answer."

    "- Building a personal research assistant that autonomously searches academic papers, extracts key findings, and generates literature review summaries based on specific research questions.\n",

    "- Managing social media presence by analyzing trending topics, generating relevant content, scheduling posts, and engaging with followers through personalized responses.\n",
    "- Building an autonomous testing agent that generates test cases, executes tests, analyzes failures, and provides detailed bug reports with suggested fixes.\n",

    "- Call model: We ask the model for a response; it may include `tool_calls`.\n",
    "- Check `tool_calls`: If none are returned, the loop ends and we show the final answer.\n",
    "- Append assistant message: If there are tool calls, we append the assistant’s message (which contains them) to `messages`.\n",
    "- Execute tools: For each tool call, we run the matching Python function with the provided JSON arguments.\n",
    "- Reply with tool outputs: For every tool call, we append a `role: tool` message using the exact `tool_call_id`.\n",
    "- Repeat: With the new tool outputs in `messages`, we call the model again. This continues until no tool calls are requested.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tool Execution in the Loop (Cell 13)\n",
    "- Detect and collect tool calls: The model returns a list of `tool_calls`, each with `function.name`, `function.arguments` (JSON), and a unique `id`.\n",
    "- Append assistant tool-call message: We add the assistant message (containing the `tool_calls`) to `messages` before executing any tools.\n",
    "- Execute each tool in order: For every call, we parse args via `json.loads(call.function.arguments)` and dispatch to `search_knowledge_base()` or `generate_keywords()` based on `call.function.name`.\n",
    "- Collect results per call: We build `{\"tool_call_id\": call.id, \"content\": result}` for each executed tool.\n",
    "- Respond to the model per call: We append a `role: tool` message for each result using its exact `tool_call_id`. This is required by the API.\n",
    "- All tools are executed: If multiple tools are requested in a single iteration, we execute all of them (none are skipped), then call the model again.\n",
    "- Ordering: Tools are executed sequentially in the order provided by `tool_calls` (not in parallel).\n",
    "\n",
    "Why the `tool_call_id` matters:\n",
    "- Each assistant tool call must be followed by a `role: tool` message for that specific `tool_call_id`, otherwise the API returns an error.\n",

      "It seems that the search results did not return relevant information specifically about basic cryptography. However, here's a basic overview of cryptography based on general knowledge:\n",
      "\n",
      "### What is Cryptography?\n",
      "Cryptography is the practice and study of techniques for securing communication and information from adversaries. It involves creating written or generated codes that allow information to be kept secret.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Key Concepts:\n",
      "1. **Encryption**: The process of converting plaintext (readable data) into ciphertext (encoded data) using algorithms and keys. Only those with the correct key can decrypt the ciphertext back into plaintext.\n",
      "   \n",
      "2. **Decryption**: The reverse process of encryption, transforming ciphertext back into plaintext.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Keys**: Strings of bits used by encryption algorithms. The security of encryption relies on the length and complexity of the keys.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Hash Functions**: Cryptographic algorithms that take an input and produce a fixed-size string of characters that is unique to the input. Hash functions are used for data integrity checks and password storage.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)**: A framework that uses pairs of keys (public and private) for encryption. The public key is shared openly, while the private key is kept secret.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Digital Signatures**: A cryptographic technique that allows a person to sign digital messages or documents, verifying that the message has not been altered and confirming the identity of the sender.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Types of Cryptography:\n",
      "- **Symmetric Key Cryptography**: Uses the same key for both encryption and decryption.\n",
      "- **Asymmetric Key Cryptography**: Uses a pair of keys; one for encryption (public key) and another for decryption (private key).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Applications:\n",
      "- Secure communications (e.g., messaging apps, email encryption)\n",
      "- Data integrity verification\n",
      "- Secure online transactions (e.g., SSL/TLS for web security)\n",
      "- Authentication processes (e.g., password hashing, two-factor authentication)\n",
      "\n",
