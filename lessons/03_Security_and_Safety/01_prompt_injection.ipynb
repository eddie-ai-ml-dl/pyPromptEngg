       "> 5. **Technology and Interior Features**: Evaluate the technological offerings, including infotainment systems, connectivity options (like Apple CarPlay and Android Auto), driver-assistance features, and the quality of the materials used in the interior. Comfort and ergonomics can also play a significant role in your overall satisfaction with the car.\n",
